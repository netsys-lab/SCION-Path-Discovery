// Pathselection/Multipath library draft 0.0.2
//
// These code fragments aim to provide an initial design for a "multipath library" that provides
// a generic interface for path monitoring to gather information and path selection based on these information
// Although the library must be designed to be integrated into any kind of application, this first draft is tailored
// to be integrated into Bittorrent.

// Designing and implementing a multipath library in SCION emerges the following two core problems (along with many others):
// 1) Path selection: Out of a potential huge set of paths, which of these should the library use
// 2) Packet scheduling: Which packet is sent over which path by the library

// Since Bittorrent provides its own logic for packet scheduling (not on packet, but on chunk level),
// this is not yet covered by this draft. However, it can be implemented on top of the interfaces and structs
// defined here.

// This draft covers the following design idea of a multipath library: To not implement a dedicated
// packet scheduler at the moment (which may be of course useful later), the library provides an API
// that provides an "optimal" set of paths to the applications and a socket that provides connections
// over the respective paths. The application can read and write data over the provided connections.
// Furthermore, the connections collect metrics under the hood which are then used for potential
// changes to the optimal path set.
// If the path set changes, an event will be emitted to the application, which can then react to the
// new set of optimal paths. This is my first idea that can be integrated into Bittorrent without re-implementing
// packet scheduling

// Note: The main func here is an example of an app using the library, so the code in there should
// not part of the library. We could also move this part into examples folder

// Connection States, need to be redefined/extended
