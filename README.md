# Draft of a multipath/path-selection library 

These code fragments aim to provide an initial design for a "multipath library" that provides a generic interface for path monitoring to gather information and path selection based on these information. Although the library must be designed to be integrated into any kind of application, this first draft is tailored to be integrated into Bittorrent.

See `main.go` for the draft implementation.
